## No dedicated tab for chrome extensions

Chrome extensions have popup.html and options.html but no landing.html it seems.

## Content Script vs Background Script

You use content scripts to manipulate and respond to the DOM of a particular webpage

You use background scripts to respond to events and for APIs

## Can't use JS to move to the next tab programmatically

I thought it would be easy to navigate to the next tab via JS but it looks like it's disallowed for security reasons.

It makes a lot of sense, interesting to think about.
