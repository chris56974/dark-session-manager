# [Dark Session Manager (DSM)](https://github.com/chris56974/dark-session-manager)

DSM is a session manager inspired by [Workona](https://workona.com/). The emphasis is not on work but on organized browsing. I don't plan on doing any cloud integrations (Figma, GCloud, Zoom), [universal search](https://workona.com/help/search/), [templates](https://workona.com/templates/),[mobile apps](https://workona.com/help/mobile-support/), etc. If you want all that, you should check out [Workona](https://workona.com/).

## Features

- Computer/Browser awareness for local file links
- Workspaces/Resources/Tabs
- [File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API) for note taking and pdf previews.
- User choice of UI (bookmark, Page)
- Performant (vanilla JS, no tracking)

- `Alt + t` -> Save/Move Tab
