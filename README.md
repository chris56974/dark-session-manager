# [Dark Session Manager (DSM)](https://github.com/chris56974/dark-session-manager)

DSM is a session manager inspired by [Workona](https://workona.com/). I don't plan on doing any cloud integrations (Figma, GCloud, Zoom), [universal search](https://workona.com/help/search/), [mobile apps](https://workona.com/help/mobile-support/), [templates](https://workona.com/templates/), etc. If you want all that, you should check out [Workona](https://workona.com/).

## Features

- [File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API) for note taking and pdf previews.
- Computer/Browser awareness for local file links
- Limitless Workspaces/Resources/Tabs
- User choice of UI (bookmark, Page)
- Highly performant (vanilla JS, no tracking)

## Shortcuts

- `Alt + t` -> Save/Move Tab
- `Alt + n` -> New Workspace
- `Alt + a` -> Switch Workspace
- `Alt + w` -> Close workspace
- `Alt + f` -> Open DSM
